Repo: lho2-ylu4
>> Checkpoint: No design worksheet but pthread control flow present
[ pts off up to 1 ]: 0
>> Partitioning: 
[ pts off up to 2 ]: 0

>> Synchronization and Parallelization: More calls to wait at the barrier than needed. E.g. you do not need to
use the barrier around locking the total_live count since you use a
mutex. This wait likely causes a significant slowdown
[ pts off up to 7 ]: 0.5
