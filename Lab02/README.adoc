= Lab2

This is starting point code for CS31 Lab 2

To compile:


  make

To clean-up compiled code:

   make clean

To answer Part1 questions, open `part1.txt` in your favorite text editor and
edit the file adding in your answers.

To answer Part2 questions, open `lab2.c` and add your C code solutions (then
type make to compile):

   make
   ./lab2

To add and commit changes to your git repo and push to GitHub:

   git add lab2.c part1.txt
   git commit       # opens an editor for entering your commit comment
   git push

You can also combine the commit and commit message in one command
(and you only need to git add files you have modified since the
last time you add-commit-pushed):

   git add lab2.c
   git commit -m "finished q1-q4"
   git push

Make sure that you perform an add, commit, and push of your `lab2.c`
and `part1.txt` solutions before the due date of the lab.
